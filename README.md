 to configure USWDS For NASA go into the Theme Folder and edit _uswds-theme-custom-styles.scss. Then follow the directions.
 its seem to be the file that allows you to put custom content. you make changes be using the the "@include"  follow by the argument and parameters. i.e. "@include u-padding-right('05');". The _uswds-theme-styles.scss is the last to load in the loadorder and takes priority.
